# DMS 🚧

The purpose of this repository is to provide a component library that is demonstrated through storybook and tested using jest. I have added additional libraries (such as webpack and babel) in case this turns into more than a component library further down the line.

## Contains 🎁
- React ⚛
- ESLint 🕵️‍♂️
- Webpack 📦
- Babel ⚙️
- Live updating ♻️
- Storybook 📚
- Jest and Enzyme testing 🧪

## Scripts 🖌

- `npm run lint` to lint the project (ESLint config file provided)
- `npm run webpack` to build and bundle the project into a `build` directory (not provided here)
- `npm run storybook` to run storybook at `localhost:6006`
